# Virtual Pet

See the HELP.md for assignment directions and guide.

+++ Added VirtualPet class
+++ Added attributes (Hunger, Thirst, Boredom, Sleepiness, Aggression)
    --> Attributes increase at different rates
+++ Added methods (.eats() , .drinks(), .plays() , .sleeps() , .potties())
    --> Methods change attributes in different ways 
+++ Added tick() action to every action method
+++ Functional game loop
+++ if attribute reaches 100, increase aggression
    --> aggression > 100, game over

Ideas:
@@ adjust rate at which needs change based on virtual pet / circumstance
